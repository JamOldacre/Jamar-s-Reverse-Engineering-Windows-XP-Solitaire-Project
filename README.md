# Jamar-s-Reverse-Engineering-Windows-XP-Solitaire-Project
Reverse-engineered Windows XP Solitaire by combining static and dynamic analysis (Ghidra, x64dbg) to analyze assembly logic, manipulate memory, and modify game behavior. Customized gameplay by disabling timers, altering scoring mechanics, changing background colors, and replacing default graphics with custom assets using Resource Hacker.

Must have cards.dll and sol_modded.exe in same folder for program to work properly.
